# softmax-linear-regression-mnist
This repository contains the second assignment for the Intro to Machine Learning course, focusing on regression techniques applied to the MNIST dataset. The assignment is divided into two parts:

Softmax Regression: Implemented softmax regression to perform multi-class classification on the MNIST dataset, providing a probabilistic approach to classify handwritten digits.

Linear Regression: Implemented linear regression to explore its application on the MNIST dataset, examining how a simpler regression model performs on a classification problem.
